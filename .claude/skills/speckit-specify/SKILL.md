## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before specification)**:
- Discover hooks across **all** extension files (multi-file discovery), not just the central file:
  - Read `.specify/extensions.yml` from the project root (if present) and collect entries under the `hooks.before_specify` key.
  - Then enumerate every `.specify/extensions/*/*.yml` file in sorted order, parse each, and collect its `hooks.before_specify` entries too — so a hook registered only in a per-extension file (e.g. the `feedback` extension at `.specify/extensions/feedback/feedback.yml`) is still discovered and runs.
  - Merge all collected entries and dedupe by `(extension, command)` (first occurrence wins, so a hook declared in both the central and a per-extension file runs once).
  - If a file is absent, no hooks are registered, or its YAML cannot be parsed/is invalid, skip that file silently and continue.
- For every `optional: true` hook that is discovered but not executed this phase, emit one line so the skip is a visible decision: `Note: optional hook {extension}:{command} is registered but was not run (skipped).`
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- Do **not** interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```

## Outline

The text the user typed after `/speckit-specify` in the triggering message **is** the feature description; assume it is available in this conversation even if `$ARGUMENTS` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

Given that feature description, do this:

1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the feature:
   - Extract the most meaningful keywords to capture the feature's essence
   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., "add-user-auth", "fix-payment-bug")
   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)
   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand at a glance
   - Examples:
     - "I want to add user authentication" → "user-auth"
     - "Implement OAuth2 integration for the API" → "oauth2-api-integration"
     - "Create a dashboard for analytics" → "analytics-dashboard"
     - "Fix payment processing timeout bug" → "fix-payment-timeout"

2. **Branch creation** (optional, via hook):

   If a `before_specify` hook ran successfully in the Pre-Execution Checks above, it will have created/switched to a git branch and output JSON containing `BRANCH_NAME` and `FEATURE_NUM`. Note these values for reference, but the branch name does **not** dictate the spec directory name.

   If the user explicitly provided `GIT_BRANCH_NAME`, pass it through to the hook so the branch script uses the exact value as the branch name (bypassing all prefix/suffix generation).

3. **Create the spec feature directory**:

   Specs live under the default `specs/` directory unless the user explicitly provides `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY`.

   **Resolution order for `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY`**:
   1. If the user explicitly provided `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY` (via environment variable, argument, or configuration), use it as-is
   2. Otherwise, auto-generate it under `specs/`:
      - Check `.specify/init-options.json` for `branch_numbering`
      - If `"timestamp"`: prefix is `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` (current timestamp)
      - If `"sequential"` or absent: prefix is `NNN` (next available 3-digit number after scanning existing directories in `specs/`)
      - Construct the directory name `<prefix>-<short-name>` (e.g., `003-user-auth` or `20260319-143022-user-auth`) and set `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY` to `specs/<directory-name>`

   **Create the directory and spec file**:
   - `mkdir -p SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY`
   - Copy `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY/spec.md` as the starting point
   - Set `SPEC_FILE` to `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY/spec.md`
   - Persist the resolved path to `.specify/feature.json`:
     ```json
     {
       "feature_directory": "<resolved feature dir>"
     }
     ```
     Write the actual resolved directory path value (for example, `specs/003-user-auth`), not the literal string `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY`.
     This allows downstream commands (`/speckit-plan`, `/speckit-tasks`, etc.) to locate the feature directory without relying on git branch name conventions.

   **Snapshot an external-URL source spec into the feature directory**:
   - If the feature input is an **external URL** (the source spec lives at a remote
     location, e.g. a GitHub URL), then after fetching the source, write a snapshot to
     `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY/source-spec.md` with a header recording the source URL
     and the fetch context, and have `spec.md` reference the in-repo
     `source-spec.md` snapshot rather than the live URL. This captures provenance
     in-repo so the specify phase is reproducible offline and does not silently
     depend on a remote that may move or change.
   - If the feature input is a **local file or inline text**, this snapshot step is an
     explicit **no-op** — do not fabricate a redundant `source-spec.md` copy.
   - **Multi-file external source (feature 085, FR-016).** When the source spec is **not a
     single file** but a **directory/tree** of files at a remote (e.g. a GitHub folder of
     `.md` parts), snapshot the whole set, not just one URL:
     1. **Enumerate** the tree — for GitHub, the contents API
        `https://api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo>/contents/<path>?ref=<ref>` lists the
        files (or use the `git/trees/<ref>?recursive=1` API for a deep tree).
     2. **Fetch each file** in a stable (sorted) order.
     3. **Assemble** them into one `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY/source-spec.md` with a top
        header recording the source tree URL + ref + fetch context, and a **per-file header**
        (`## <relative/path>` + the file's own source URL) before each file's content, so the
        composite is reproducible offline and each part's provenance is preserved. `spec.md`
        references the assembled in-repo `source-spec.md`, never the live tree.

   **IMPORTANT**:
   - Create only one feature per `/speckit-specify` invocation
   - The spec directory name and the git branch name are independent — they may match, but that is the user's choice
   - The spec directory and file are always created by this command, never by the hook

4. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.

5. Follow this execution flow:
    1. Parse user description from arguments
       If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
    2. Extract key concepts from description
       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
    3. For unclear aspects:
       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards
       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:
         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience
         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications
         - No reasonable default exists
       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**
       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details
    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
       If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
    5. Generate Functional Requirements
       Each requirement must be testable
       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)
    6. Define Success Criteria
       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes
       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)
       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details
    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

6. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.

7. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:

   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:

      ```markdown
      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]
      
      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
      **Created**: [DATE]
      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]

      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification
      
      ## Notes
      
      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`
      ```

   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:
      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails
      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)

   c. **Handle Validation Results**:

      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 8

      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:
        1. List the failing items and specific issues
        2. Update the spec to address each issue
        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)
        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn the user

      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:
        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec
        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest
        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to the user in this format:

           ```markdown
           ## Question [N]: [Topic]
           
           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]
           
           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]
           
           **Suggested Answers**:
           
           | Option | Answer | Implications |
           |--------|--------|--------------|
           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |
           
           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
           ```

        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:
           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned
           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`
           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`
           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview
        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)
        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses
        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., "Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B")
        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer
        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved

   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status

8. **Report completion** to the user with:
   - `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY` — the feature directory path
   - `SPEC_FILE` — the spec file path
   - Checklist results summary
   - Readiness for the next phase (`/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`)

9. **Check for extension hooks**: After reporting completion, discover hooks across **all** extension files (multi-file discovery), not just the central file:
   - Read `.specify/extensions.yml` from the project root (if present) and collect entries under the `hooks.after_specify` key.
   - Then enumerate every `.specify/extensions/*/*.yml` file in sorted order, parse each, and collect its `hooks.after_specify` entries too — so a hook registered only in a per-extension file (e.g. the `feedback` extension at `.specify/extensions/feedback/feedback.yml`) is still discovered and runs on phase completion.
   - Merge all collected entries and dedupe by `(extension, command)` (first occurrence wins, so a hook declared in both files runs once).
   - **Hook execution precedence** (D1): when `settings.auto_execute_hooks: true` in `.specify/extensions.yml`, a **mandatory** hook (`optional: false`) **auto-runs** with no confirmation; an **optional** hook (`optional: true`) is **always surfaced** ("To execute: `/{command}`") and is **never force-run** by `auto_execute_hooks`; a hook with a non-empty `condition` is **never** evaluated by this skill — evaluation is left to the executor and the notice reports the resolved decision. When `auto_execute_hooks: false`, even mandatory hooks are surfaced for confirmation.
   - **Effective-hooks notice** (D2): after the merge + dedup by `(extension, command)`, emit **one** consolidated notice for the phase so the operator never hand-reconciles files — the promoted feedback hook (`optional: false`) appears as `auto-run`, never as a surfaced optional:
     ```
     ## Effective hooks for specify
     - {extension}:{command} — auto-run        (mandatory; auto_execute_hooks=true)
     - {extension}:{command} — surfaced        (optional)
     - {extension}:{command} — skipped         (enabled: false)
     - {extension}:{command} — condition-deferred
     ```
   - If a file is absent, no hooks are registered, or its YAML cannot be parsed/is invalid, skip that file silently and continue.
   - For every `optional: true` hook that is discovered but not executed this phase, emit one line so the skip is a visible decision: `Note: optional hook {extension}:{command} is registered but was not run (skipped).`
   - Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
   - Do **not** interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
     - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
     - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
   - For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
     - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
       ```
       ## Extension Hooks

       **Optional Hook**: {extension}
       Command: `/{command}`
       Description: {description}

       Prompt: {prompt}
       To execute: `/{command}`
       ```
     - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
       ```
       ## Extension Hooks

       **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
       Executing: `/{command}`
       EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
       ```

**NOTE:** Branch creation is handled by the `before_specify` hook (git extension). Spec directory and file creation are always handled by this core command.

## Quick Guidelines

- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.
- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).
- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.
- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps
2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section
3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers — use only for critical decisions that significantly impact scope or UX, have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications, or lack any reasonable default
4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details
5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):
   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)
   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)
   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)

**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):

- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain
- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified
- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks
- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps
- Integration patterns: Use project-appropriate patterns (REST/GraphQL for web services, function calls for libraries, CLI args for tools, etc.)

### Success Criteria Guidelines

Success criteria must be:

1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)
2. **Technology-agnostic**: No frameworks, languages, databases, or tools
3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from a user/business perspective, not system internals
4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details

**Good examples**:

- "Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes"
- "System supports 10,000 concurrent users"
- "95% of searches return results in under 1 second"
- "Task completion rate improves by 40%"

**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):

- "API response time is under 200ms" (too technical, use "Users see results instantly")
- "Database can handle 1000 TPS" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)
- "React components render efficiently" (framework-specific)
- "Redis cache hit rate above 80%" (technology-specific)
